# Marketing Analysis
This project analyzes marketing data to uncover trends, measure customer engagement, and understand sentiment.
The work combines SQL for cleaning and organizing the data, Python for calculating and categorizing sentiment scores 
and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard. The final result is a clear view of customer opinions and engagement patterns, helping guide better marketing decisions.
